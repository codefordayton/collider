Founded in 2004, Hightail was working in the cloud before the term was even coined. At first our service was a simple way to send the large attachments that email couldn’t process, but we’ve since grown to offer robust online file storage, sharing and management capabilities. Our renowned reliability and data security make Hightail the go-to solution for businesses, big and small.                       
We are a technology company built around engineers, developers and operations working in small, independent teams where everyone is expected to voice opinions and have a material impact. We earn a real and sustainable revenue, and with a goal of doubling our user base quickly, everything we do focuses on scaling for massive growth.

Our number one priority is making Hightail a great place to work because we believe that great culture attracts great people who create great products. We like passionate, creative, wicked smart folks who take the initiative and don’t ever want to hand it back. If that sounds like you, and you want a career-changing experience in an exciting and growing industry, find your next great job here.
